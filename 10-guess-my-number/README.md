## Guess the Number Game Project

A project designed to learn the fundamentals of React by building an interactive number guessing game.

The goal of the game is to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The player receives feedback like "Too high!", "Too low!", or "Correct!" based on their input.

You can find an image of the result view in the public/result folder.
